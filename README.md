### Hi there 👋 👨‍💻

Hi, I make things. I’m a <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/circlecube/" target="_blank">core contributor</a> to WordPress, <a  href="https://circlecube.com/does-wordpress/" target="_blank">speaker</a> at WordCamps, and currently a Senior Front End Engineer at <a href="https://10up.com/about/#employee-evan-mullins" target="_blank">10up</a>.

While I have a design background, I’ve found a stronger creative outlet writing code. I’m also digital nomad with wanderlust for life, so lately have been travelling with my wife and 4 growing kids! 🧔 + 🧑‍🦰 = 👦 👦 👦 👧
